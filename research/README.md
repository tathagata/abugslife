Feedback from mentors and peers:
There is a lot to love in what you sent. It is easy to see why your presentation was selected.

The concept is awesome, tracing a sample bug to learn lessons from it -- like a virtual post-mortem
The topic is evergreen and important. People need to know this stuff.
I love the focus on storytelling. It never hurts to borrow from the best in that space. Awesome! (now I want to watch A Bug's Life)
Regarding your questions:

I'm not sure I understand the sync to the slide-deck bit? Are you usuing an auto-advancing slide-deck (the link doesn't do that -- not automatically at least). I always use a presentation mouse so I can click forward and backward when I need to. There will be plenty of them available. As long as we are not speaking at the same time, which we shouldn't be, you are welcome to use mine if you like. Of course, if an auto-advancing slide deck works for you, more power to you. Use whatever works for you. Also, I'm probably misunderstanding anyway ;-)
You can see some of what it is like to speak at CodeMash from the photos posted on social media. Here is the CodeMash hashtag on Mastodon. Some of those images are the big room, which is mostly for Keynotes, Lightning talks, and some of the biggest topics/speakers. Some decent examples might be this or this.

I've found it very hard to predict, regardless of the topic or even timeslot, how many people will attend a talk. I've had talks that I expected to be empty, turn out overflowing, but usually the opposite. Every speaker has, at one time or another, spoken to a mostly empty room. One of the most sought-after speakers I know once gave a talk to a single person. This is not a big deal and you should try not to worry about such things. I am not a conference organizer, but I do work with several User Groups, I know group leaders are embarrased when we can't get enough attendees for a speaker. That is on us, not the speaker. I strongly suspect it is the same way for conference organizers.

As I recall, there are always HDMI connections and podiums. Microphones will always be available for the large rooms. For smaller rooms, it is usually up to you. I believe they will have one for you if you want it.

I don't usually ask my audience who they are because they came to see my topic, and I made it clear what it was. You did too, so I wouldn't worry no matter how basic you think it is. Some of the most amazing speakers focus on the basics. It is important and always needed.
I did notice one or two things I might disagree with in your talk (depending on how it is presented). For example, I strongly disagree with ever measuring code coverage as an organization. I always use it as a developer, but it should, IMO, never be measured. My article on the topic tells you why. That said, this is your talk and you should take it whatever way sparks your passion, especially if you disagree with me :-)

Audience Q&A is usually up to you. I like to wrap my slides a few minutes early and then use the rest of the time to ask the audience questions like "What rang true/false for you about this topic?" to try and get a dialog going. Some speakers prefer to take questions inline, others would rather people wait until the end. Just make it clear to your audience what you expect from them and they'll almost certainly play along.
When fielding questions, don't be afraid to say things like "I don't know but we can look at that at lunch" or "I'm not sure offhand but I'll be happy to get back to you on that". You're the expert in the room, but nobody knows everything, and your audience doesn't expect you to.

Don't worry too much about updating the talk to keep up with everything. I often say things like "I have tasks on my task list to explore X" so I can add that to future versions of this talk. If you have a blog, that's a great reference to give them so they can follow-along as you add to the talk. You just then have to post about what you've added, when you do so. There is no way to keep every talk 100% up-to-date. I've seen it where talks were almost completely derailed by changes published overnight by Microsoft or others. That is super-rare, especially if you aren't working with pre-release tools, but it can happen. Nothing to do but plow forward if that happens. The important thing is to add what you can when it is relevant, and not worry about the rest.
You may have noticed me say "don't worry" a lot. That's because it is probably the most important thing about public speaking. There are so many things we could worry about, if we do, we're cooked. Do everything you can and nothing more, and then just go with it. I can already see from what you've sent that you'll be amazing. I hope I have the opportunity to see your talk.

Response to Barry's feedback:

The overhang of not being able to respond sooner to such a detailed thoughtful feedback was killing me!
I truly appreciate your guidance and insights!

On the sync to slide - the slides show a slack conversation in progress, and I read out from a written script like background narration. Scrolling the script on the phone keeps one hand engaged, leaving the other to handle both the slide transitions and the microphone. Makes it challenging to land the theatrics and timing. Thanks for the protip on presentation mouse - checking out if it would work with marp - my markdown presentation tool!

All other points resonated and has helped push up the confidence barometer, adding to the todo-s.
Loved reading the blog - totally aligned on code coverage measurements - was expecting the meme next to it do the heavy lifting of conveying the message similar to Goodhart's law - looks like it didn't work? 
That metric-a-fication comes with blind spots and subject to abuse/misuse/misinterpretation - I should loudly call it out.
If you don't mind me stealing, let me make an actual reference to Goodhart's law!

One more time - thank you, thank you, thank you!
Closer to the conference date will reach out for some hallway track time.
