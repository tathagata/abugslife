Now before we dive in, we first need to realize features and bugs 

features have their inception in as stroke of genius in the minds of product
bugs have their inception moments are riddled with a failure of the working software

features are well thought out, without PRDs, design docs, ui mock ups
bugs are patched, and we move on

Features get all the drum rolls in release notes, but bug fixes are just a footnote - miscellaneous bug fixes.

Bugs are the unwanted orphans that no one likes - users, stakeholders, developers, sre, even QA. We want them squashed, we announce bounties to eradicate them. Even our tooling uses language that makes it obvious that it is shameful moment when people find out that you are the one who introduced that bug.
