# What Needs to Change Other Than Code - Partnership

The distributed and connected nature of today's software is such that being written all the way from scratch - you have multiple internal and external teams, you have open source dependencies. And the reality is everyone has their own goals and priorities - your emergency might not be there priority.

Empathy
So even if you are on a team that scores straight A-s on every metrics, that might not be true for your upstream or downstream teams. Your team is a part of a supply chain of values to the customer and the only thing that keeps this chain from breaking apart is trust.

Trust
Trust is like cache - easier to build with locality of reference, when people get together same room. 

Remember at the other end of each line of code is a human being who wrote the code or the prompt
At the other end of your pr - there is a human being / should be a human being
Now this is not a AI talk, but I think as of middle of 2025, we are not there yet that we can ship code to prod without a human taking a look.
Humans are still kicking the rear side because of token limits.
So imagine all the meetings you have had, the emails, the jira tickets, the code that you have written, the previous bugs that you have written - in summary the context that you have, you are still the best MCP server the AI can plug into.
But the real reason might be in case of a crisis you trust a human to take responsibility, as we cannot yet sue AI!
Make judgment calls under pressure. Build trust between teams during crisis.


Honest communication
So trust and empathy are soft words how do you make it concrete and actionable.
Trust, empathy and honest communications are how you build great partnership.

- Your support rotation calendar should be easily accessible. Include who is primary, who is backup, who is on vacation and how to reach you.
**Questions your next bug will ask:**
- Who verifies weekend releases?
- What happens when the expert is at a conference?
- How do you hand off context across time zones?
- Solution: Bugs are inevitable. Budget for them.
- Empathy is bandwidthâ€”measured in time and dollars
- Features add revenue, bugs subtract it. Both deserve equal investment.


**Knowledge lives in silos.** The person who wrote the code moved teams. The runbook is outdated. The tribal knowledge walked out the door.
