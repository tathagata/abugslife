# What Needs to Change Other Than Code - Partnership

Trust, empathy and honest communications are how you build great partnership.
The distributed and connected nature of today's software is such that being written all the way from scratch - you have multiple internal and external teams, you have open source dependencies. And the reality is everyone has their own goals and priorities - your emergency might not be there priority.

Empathy
Empathy is bandwidth—measured in time and dollars
So even if you are on a team that scores straight A-s on every metrics, that might not be true for your upstream or downstream teams. Your team is a part of a supply chain of values to the customer and the only thing that keeps this chain from breaking apart is trust.

Trust
Trust is like cache - easier to build with locality of reference, when people get together same room. 

Remember at the other end of each line of code is a human being who wrote the code or the prompt
At the other end of your pr - there is a human being / should be a human being
Now this is not a AI talk, but I think as of middle of 2025, we are not there yet that we can ship code to prod without a human taking a look.
Humans are still kicking the rear side because of token limits.
So imagine all the meetings you have had, the emails, the jira tickets, the code that you have written, the previous bugs that you have written - in summary the context that you have, you are still the best MCP server the AI can plug into.
But the real reason might be in case of a crisis you trust a human to take responsibility, as we cannot yet sue AI!
Make judgment calls under pressure. Build trust between teams during crisis.


Honest communication

Start from your deadlines and work backward to plan upstream and downstream dependencies.
If you don’t own your plan, someone else will—and they might get it wrong.
Announce early, recalibrate them openly when things change.
Share risks and tradeoffs early—transparency builds trust.
Even if you’re delayed, give teams a heads-up is all about setting and meeting expectations.
Pre-plan post-release verification with the right stakeholders, Make sure someone’s available to validate after the release.
Don’t just inform—ask for feedback. Adjust based on what you hear.
Your support calendar should be visible—with primary, backup, PTO, and how to engage, scope of your work
Now Ask other teams to do the same for you.
This creates an environment where people can speak up early—without fear of being wrong.
