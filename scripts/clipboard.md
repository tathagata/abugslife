### Communication in Crisis

- Multiple Slack channels
- Remote, hybrid, multiple timezones
- Stakeholder pressure escalating

### The Tech Debt Reality Check

We ship the minimum viable fix because we're always racing to the next fire. But here's what accumulates:
- **Technical Debt**: The "I'll refactor this later" that never happens
- **Process Debt**: The shortcuts that become permanent workflows  
- **Knowledge Debt**: The tribal knowledge that lives in one person's head

Every bug is a loan payment on this debt.

### Bug Fixes Don't Get the Love They Deserve

New features get comprehensive tests. Bug fixes? Often just a quick patch. **This is backwards.** Every bug fix should add a test that prevents regression.


### The False Security of 100% Coverage

**Unit Tests**: Great for logic, terrible for integration
- Your mocks lie when external service contracts change
- 100% coverage ≠ 100% confidence

**Integration Tests**: Closer to reality, but expensive
- Slow to run, hard to maintain
- Test environments are production's distant cousins

**The Gap**: The further your test environment from production, the more bugs slip through

### Testing in Production: The Ultimate Truth

- **Chaos Engineering**: Intentionally break things to find weaknesses
- **Canary Deployments**: Let production tell you what's wrong
- **Feature Flags**: Instant rollback without redeployment

**Game Changer**: DevContainers bring production to your laptop 


**Features** are planned, nurtured, celebrated—they're pets.
**Bugs** are unwanted orphans that nobody claims—treated like pests.

But here's the truth: **Bugs teach you more about your system than features ever will.**


**Problem 1: Empathy Deficit**
- Solution: Bugs are inevitable. Budget for them.
- Empathy is bandwidth—measured in time and dollars
- Features add revenue, bugs subtract it. Both deserve equal investment.

**Problem 3: CICD as Assembly Line, Not Platform**
- Solution: Your CICD is Ford's conveyor belt—but are you using all its features?
- Team integration via webhooks and APIs
- If shipping takes more than two weeks, you're waiting too long
