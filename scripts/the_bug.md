*Ding.*

It’s 9:35 a.m. on a Monday. Fifty-seven floors above the chaos of New York’s financial district, a slack message so loud that it is about to send tremors through Antelligence's Low Latency Market Data group.
OpsGenie: “P1: Goldkern Sacks: Dashboards not loading!!!”

Flick, from L1 support has barely taken the first sip of the coffee that morning as he sees this message.
He jumps between Slack, OpsGenie, Confluence looking a runbook: “dashboard outage.” "Empty dashboard".
After 10 minutes of frantic searching - he has Nothing useful. 

@heimlich @atta.incidentmgr All GS dashboards are down. No visualizations. Client is blind. Need help ASAP.
Searched Confluence, runbooks. Anyone have a link?

Heimlich was about to go on his lunch break, doesn't look like that is going to happen.
He responds with a bunch of questions.
Is it just one client? One user? Did you ask them to clear their browser cache? Actually are they using a Supported browser? 
It might be their Firewall rule changes, can you ask to check if they are blocking websockets?

Its past 10 o'clock and Flick can tell Hopper is losing it. 

We need this fixed NOW. This is costing us millions.

Heimlich is digging through logs: Logs show standard third-party errors. Nothing new. Still investigating.

Manny (manny.sre) joinshahsdjkhfaksjdhfalksjdh: Checking frontend pod logs. Seeing some errors, but these are old. Not related to outage.

Atta (atta.incidentmgr) escalates: @everyone Hopper has escalated to Antelligence execs. We need coordinated updates.

Then, a clue from Manny: Backend JSON payload has empty data field. Row count zero. @francis.cpp wrote this service but he’s at CPP Con.

Manny again: Was there a release this weekend? What changed? Anyone checked Data team’s Airflow cluster?

Slim (slim.data) joins: Joining the call. Checking Airflow logs now. Clock is ticking.

Hopper (hopper.debt) again: Still no data since market open. Losses are mounting. Top Antelligence execs are now on this thread.

The SRE asks: Was there a release this weekend? What changed?

Desperation sets in. Has anyone checked the Data team’s Airflow cluster? Who’s on call? They’re at lunch. Someone pings their boss.

The Data team boss joins the huddle—hands-on, sleeves rolled up, eyes on the Airflow logs. The clock is ticking. Millions are at stake. The pressure is suffocating.
Seems like one of the batch jobs have failed to read a
