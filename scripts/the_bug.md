Its 9:35 am, Monday morning on the 57th floor in the financial district in New York city.  
A notification shows up on Flick's phone who was just about settle down on his seat and take the first sip of his coffee.  
His heart sank as he recalled he was on support this week  
And as he caught the name of the client in the emailid his heart almost stopped  
This was going to be a very long morning  

Flik goes into the chat message to assess how bad it is  
As an L1 support, he is the first line of defence - and has to ackknowledge to the client that their issues are getting addressed  
None of the visualizations on the dashboards are loading  
He quickly does a confluence search to see if there was a runbook for such and error - but the search isnt useful - a number of hits, not a single one useful  

9:45 - completely clueless, Flik now tags the data alerts to page those from the data team
