# The New Normal - Why do we need to change

#TODO slide – Flick with his back to the audience, shoulders drooping in shame. A small rock next to him on one side, and his other inventions broken beside him.

A bug reduces the value delivered to the customer.
A bug can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, even loss of human life.
But overall, we treat a bug as an indicator that due diligence was not done before shipping.

We first need to acknowledge that features and bugs have the complete opposite life cycle.
We look at bugs are the unwanted orphans - hated by users, stakeholders, developers, sre, even QAs. 
We want them squashed, we announce bounties to eradicate them. 
Even our favorite tools have language that makes shame those who introduced that bug.

Features are nurtured by Product teams with PRDs, design docs, ui mock ups, get all the drum rolls in release notes
Bugs tend to originate in production as ugly stack trace, alarms, outages, and are always hidden in foot note - miscellaneous bug fixes.


All best practices in software engineering tell us that prioritizing speed over quality increases the likelihood of bugs.
So the question is: Can we balance innovation and reliability without compromising either?



Here we are in mid-2025, when vibe coding has become the new normal.
LLM-generated code is routinely checked into production.
It is now more important than ever that our attitude toward bugs changes.



We must accept that bugs are inevitable—and focus instead on building strong guardrails that minimize their blast radius.
We need to study the life-cycle of bugs, anticipate failure modes, and treat bugs as learning checkpoints—not personal failures.
This shift in mindset demands that we treat debugging as a discipline, not just occasional damage control.

How we respond to a bug—and use it as an opportunity to plug the gaps in our software development life cycle — will determine whether we can continue to deliver value to our customers and keep up with the pace with which technology is changing.
Continuous Questioning - how can we prevent bugs even before code is written
