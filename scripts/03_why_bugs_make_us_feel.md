But why does bugs make us feel ashamed of ourselves?
It is because there is a cost associated with the bugs - not only the time it takes to fix, and test and ship - but there might be extreme price to be paid due to bugs.
So on one hand we have Silicon Valley telling us move fast and break things, and then when things break we have to pay the price.

With software eating the world, us software developers now put in place where everyday we have to make hundreds of decision - should we cut some corners to ship fast or dive deep to ensure nothing breaks when they are making a change. We are asked to build complex and dynamic ecosystems, which start as work of art but in the face of deadlines 
turn into ideal breeding ground for bugs.

In short bugs are inevitable, so we need to code is not enough - our attitude towards bugs have to change.
How we react to a bug, and use it as an opportunity to grow - will decide if can we deliver value to our customers and move at yet move at a sustainable pace.
Instead of reacting with shame, we can study patterns, anticipate failure modes, and treat bugs as inevitable learning checkpoints—not as personal flaws.

Think of bugs not as enemies to squash, but as species to understand. That shift in mindset is what makes debugging a discipline—not just damage control.
