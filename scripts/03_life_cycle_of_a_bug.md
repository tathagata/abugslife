Now before we dive in, we first need to realize features and bugs have the complete opposite life cycle

Features are nurtured by Product teams with PRDs, design docs, ui mock ups, get all the drum rolls in release notes
Bugs tend to originate in production as ugly stack trace, alarms, outages, and are always hidden in foot note - miscellaneous bug fixes.

Bugs are the unwanted orphans - hated by users, stakeholders, developers, sre, even QAs. 
We want them squashed, we announce bounties to eradicate them. 
Even our favorite tools have language that makes shame those who introduced that bug.
