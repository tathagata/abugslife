Okay - quick show of hands - anyone in the audience on support rotation this week?
Incidentally, I am on support this weekend for a system migration that's gone live and today the system is going to be put under some stress tests.
So I am just hoping this talk doesn't blow up on my face.

Thank you all for coming to this talk - I quickly introduce my self - my name is T, I work for London Stock Exchange group and handle the Site Reliability for Low Latency group there. I am developer turned SRE, so I used to create the bugs before - now I help ship them! 

This has given front row seats on many outages - and what I realized during all this is a bug and a feature have a completely opposite life cycle.

features have their inception in as stroke of genius in the minds of product
bugs have their inception moments are riddled with a failure of the working software

features are well thought out, without PRDs, design docs, ui mock ups
bugs are patched, and we move on

Features get all the drum rolls in release notes, but bug fixes are just a footnote - miscellaneous bug fixes. 

Bugs are the unwanted orphans that no one likes - users, stakeholders, developers, sre, even QA. We want them squashed, we announce bounties to eradicate them. Even our tooling uses language that makes it obvious that it is shameful moment when people find out that you are the one who introduced that bug.
