Okay - quick show of hands - anyone in the audience on support rotation this week?
Incidentally, I am on support this weekend for a system migration that's gone live and today the system is going to be put under some stress tests.
So I am just hoping this talk doesn't blow up on my face.

Thank you all for coming to this talk - I quickly introduce my self - my name is T, I work for London Stock Exchange group and handle the Site Reliability for Low Latency group there. I am developer turned SRE, so earlier I used to create the bugs - now I help ship them! 

So this talk is really about answering the question what needs to get fixed other than code when a bug is found out.

In our software we are obssessd with new features. Every release notes features get all the drum rolls, but bugs - they are just a footnote - miscellenous bug fixes. So bugs are really like the unwanted orphans no one likes - users, stakeholders, developers, sre, even QA - no one wants to see their face. We want them squashed, we want announce bug bounties to eradicate them. Even the tooling uses language that makes it obvious that it is shameful moment when people find out that you are the one who introduced that bug.
