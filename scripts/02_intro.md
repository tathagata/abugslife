Okay - quick show of hands - anyone in the audience on support rotation this week?
Incidentally, I am on support this weekend for a system migration that's gone live and today the system is going to be put under some stress tests.
So I am just hoping this talk doesn't blow up on my face.

I know I'm holding you back from lunch, so I'll quickly introduce my self - my name is T, I work for London Stock Exchange group and handle things Site Reliability for the Low Latency group. I am developer turned SRE, so I used to create the bugs before - now I help ship them! #slide

This has given front row seats on many outages - and after the crisis is over and we are doing retrospective or post mortem, I have always found myself asking the question - we patched the bug. But what else needs to change other than code?

So my goal for this talk to distill some of the learnings into a checklist that you can take away and hopefully it makes the life of the person on support a little less stressful.

## The New Normal - Why do we need to change
## Measure Baselines - Where are we today
## Change Workflows - What we do we need to change
## Build Partnerships - How do we enact the change

Continuous Questioning - how can we prevent bugs even before code is written
