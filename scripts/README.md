## Overall format
We will dive right into a hurt locker of a bug getting found out in a fictional story instead of a traditional introduction.
The first slide will be a theatrical disclaimer - all characters in this story are completely fabricated - neither do they exist in real life. 
We end the story at a cliff hanger during the post mortem of the bug and then do the speaker's introduction.
Then we discuss what is our relationship to bugs, and dive into the main topic. What else needs to change other than code.
We introduce the key ideas - life cycle of a bug, 
Give a proper playbook for teams to take away
In 2025 with AI writing so much of the code, how does it change the landscape
Finally in closing we return to the Post mortem that we have left unanswered
And end with a solid playbook/checklist that the team can take to their coworkers and immediately make an impact.
