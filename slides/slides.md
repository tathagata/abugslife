# The Tech Debt Reality Check

We ship the minimum viable fix because we're always racing to the next fire

---

# What Accumulates

- **Technical Debt**: *"I'll refactor this later"* *(never happens)*
- **Process Debt**: Shortcuts that become permanent workflows  
- **Knowledge Debt**: Tribal knowledge in one person's head

**Every bug is a loan payment on this debt**

---

# 2. Process Improvements
## The Testing Pyramid Reality

---

# Bug Fixes Don't Get the Love They Deserve

✅ **New Features**: Comprehensive tests  
❌ **Bug Fixes**: Quick patch

**This is backwards.** Every bug fix should add a test that prevents regression.

---

# The False Security of 100% Coverage

**Unit Tests**: Great for logic, terrible for integration
- Your mocks lie when external service contracts change
- 100% coverage ≠ 100% confidence

---

# Integration Tests: Closer to Reality

**But expensive:**
- Slow to run, hard to maintain
- Test environments are production's distant cousins

**The Gap**: Further your test environment from production = more bugs slip through

---

# Testing in Production: The Ultimate Truth

- **Chaos Engineering**: Intentionally break things to find weaknesses
- **Canary Deployments**: Let production tell you what's wrong  
- **Feature Flags**: Instant rollback without redeployment

**Game Changer**: DevContainers bring production to your laptop

---

# Monitoring: When Customers Become Your Alert System

**Red Flag**: If customers report issues before your monitoring does, your monitoring is broken.

---

# The Bug Story Had:
- Zero disk monitoring
- Zero alerts  
- Job silently failed for hours

---

# Three Monitoring Questions Every Bug Should Ask:

1. **Alert Volume**: Are you drowning teams in noise? *(Alert fatigue kills response)*
2. **Alert Quality**: Do alerts explain the problem AND the next action?
3. **Purpose Clarity**: Dashboards are for debugging. Alerts are for action.

---

# Remember:

> A dashboard is a debugger,  
> not an early warning system.

---

# 3. Tooling Enhancements
## The Human Factors

---

# Communication in Crisis

The bug story shows coordination chaos:
- Multiple Slack channels
- Different teams, different tools
- Remote, hybrid, multiple timezones
- Stakeholder pressure escalating

---

# Process Gaps Kill Velocity

**Questions your next bug will ask:**
- Who owns the support rotation? 
- Who verifies weekend releases?
- What happens when the expert is at a conference?
- How do you hand off context across time zones?

---

# The Locality of Reference Problem

**Knowledge lives in silos.**
- Person who wrote the code moved teams
- Runbook is outdated  
- Tribal knowledge walked out the door

**Solution**: Documentation that lives with the code, not in wikis that rot

---

# The AI Question
## Will Robots Take Our Debugging Jobs?

---

# What AI Can Do:
Generate code from prompts

# What AI Can't Do:
- Navigate coordination chaos
- Understand business context
- Make judgment calls under pressure  
- Build trust between teams during crisis

---

# A Bug Is Never Just a Code Change

It's:
- Reproducing the problem reliably
- Understanding system interactions
- Coordinating across teams and timezones  
- Making tradeoff decisions under pressure
- Building processes that prevent recurrence

---

# The 90% That Matters Most?

**That's still human work.**

---

# The Mindset Shift
## From Pets to Partners

---

# Features vs Bugs: The Adoption Gap

**Features** are planned, nurtured, celebrated—they're **pets**  
**Bugs** are unwanted orphans that nobody claims—treated like **pests**

**Truth**: Bugs teach you more about your system than features ever will.

---

# Three Organizational Problems Every Team Faces

---

# Problem 1: Empathy Deficit

**Solution**: Bugs are inevitable. Budget for them.
- Empathy is bandwidth—measured in time and dollars
- Features add revenue, bugs subtract it
- **Both deserve equal investment**

---

# Problem 2: Timeline Ownership

**Solution**: Self-empowered teams forecast their own timelines
- Plan backwards from release day
- Map dependencies, approvals, tech debt blockers
- **If you don't plan it, someone unqualified will**

---

# Problem 3: CICD as Assembly Line

**Solution**: Your CICD is Ford's conveyor belt—but are you using all its features?
- Team integration via webhooks and APIs
- **If shipping takes more than two weeks, you're waiting too long**

---

# The Production Gap

Your test environment is production's distant cousin:
- Different data volume, variety, velocity
- Different infrastructure, dependencies, configurations
- **The gap between test and prod is where bugs hide**

---

# Solution:

> Bring production closer to development,  
> not the other way around.


---

# Postmortem Action Items

**WHO** does **WHAT** by **WHEN**
