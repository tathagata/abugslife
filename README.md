# What else needs to change other than code?

## Testing

  - M0: No tests
    M1: Unit tests
    M3: System level tests with an environment close to production
        - limiataions - network/data/dependencie
           - partial coverage - some examples of how to overcome for each

    M4: Injecting failure in production


## Monitoring

  - What needs to change in our monitoring
    - do we have too less, too many alerts? Alert fatigue is real?
    - inactionable - example "CPU usage >85%". Better example: what needs to be done, better: automated remediation
      - use dashboards for debugging, not for detection
      - alerts should b


## Communication
  - teams are remote, in person, hybrid, in different timezone
  - stakeholders

## Process

  - What does your support process look like? What does your sister team's? When schdeuling a release on a weekend, who is going to
    do the verification for post release? If you have the l

## People

  - locality of reference

 
Now that we have asked ourselves a number of questions, lets ask the most important question of all?

 

Is AI going to take my job?

 

The fulcrum of this question is the success of AI at generating code from natrual language prompt.

The discussion has been very focused on code generation, but those who have lived through multi[ple

production outages, can testify - that there's a lot more than just code that is done in the whole

discipline of software engineering.

 

A bug is not only a code change.

It means reproducing the problem reliabiliy to fix our understanding about the world, could be about

the code, could be about someone else's code, could be about shifting our mindset about the abstractions

we have built. Once the new reality is understood - of course, code needs to be changed.
